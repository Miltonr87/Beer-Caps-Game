### About

Beer Caps "guess game" made with pure JS from scratch with nice UI/UX. Adapted from the concept of complex games like Naval Battleship.

### Getting Started

- Clone the repo (HTTP Protocol): ```git clone https://github.com/Miltonr87/beer-caps-game.git```

### Rules Of The Game:
_*Warning: Drink before play*_

You need to find *9 beersüç∫* in *10 shotsüéØ*. The board is mapped with the coordinates from A to G (on the vertical line) and 0 to 6 (on the horizontal line). 
If you find three beers next to each other, you get the message from *Hat-Trick* and must drink three beers before trying new guesses!

Are you a real *drinker guy* or a *nerd* one?!
